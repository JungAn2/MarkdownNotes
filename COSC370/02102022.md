Utilization
Rc	Rc	Rc	30Mbps
	R
Rs	Rs	Rs	200Mbps
How to calculate
	Find the bottleneck(Rc, Rs, R/paths (R/3 since there is 3 paths for above example)
	In the above example
		30(bottleneck)/200 = 0.15
		Round up to second non zero place

How ISP is connected together

Will not run efficient without protocol
(Is not standard layer)
Presentation layer
	Present the data

Socket
	Transfer document from network
	Goes through socket when document goes to open software(process)

Application running(process)

TCP
	Each process is associated with socket
	Gets confirmed(Connection is established)
		Then send the data (Terminology = payload)
	Applications
		Email
		Text messages
UDP
	One socket for all process
	Does not need confirmation regarding the connection
	Applications
		Netflix
		Games

Transport and network is fundamental level
Application is higher level

Network layer
	routing protocol
	Recipient has to give consent(three way handshake)

192.168.0.0 and 192.168.0.1 is reserved
External IP address which is not controlled

Linked layer
	Checks if it is not corrupted
		count how many 1’s in the whole data
		Checksum(error checking): added all the 1’s and compare to original 

Physical
	Not network job/Engineer job
	Actual physical medium

Every layer
	Adds information to payload message(header)
	For each layer, they have their own descriptive message
		Application = message
		transport = segment… Look at slide for rest first ppt Slide 41 
	Layer is done in local network	

Mini project later down the semester
	Socket project
