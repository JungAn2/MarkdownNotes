Circuit switching and packet switching part 2

Fastest physical transfer network - Fiber Optical

Already preset onto device
Circuit switching (Analog)
	Traditional telephone
	Used for one to one connection

	Old method
		Done through telecommunication company
		All wired
		People working on switch station (setup direction switch from one place to another)
Packet switching (Digital)
	Internet/Computer

Internet - global network
	Anything between local network and global is wide area network

Forwarding
	Local action
	packet goes through router and transfer to output link
	More like relay(next immediate output/ could not be the destination)
Routing
	global action
	Software level
	Figure algorithm and figure out the best path from source to destination

Packet delay
	Four sources
		processing
			Packet looking up the table(forwarding)/Next destination (determine output link)
			Error checking (See if something is missing/Virus check)
			Software level (no action)
		queueing
			Depends on arriving rate
			When arrival rate exceed the transmission rate, the packets are queued
			Limited (Router has limited memory) / Packets that exceed the limit, packets gets dropped(lost packet)
			Indicator of Traffic intensity = a * L / R
				a: average arrival rate of packet
				L: Packet length (bits)
				R: link transmission rate (bandwidth, bps)
					If indicator is close to 0, delay small
					if 1, large delay
					if greater than 1 (infinity), will wait forever so the packet will be dropped
		transmission
		 	Actions
			putting packet onto output
			Buffer(Memory)
			putting the buffer into the correct link
			Forumla = L/R [bits/speed]
				L: packet length (bits)
				R: link transmission rate (bandwidth , bps))
		propagation  
			Measured by distance to next destination
			Formula = d / p.s.
				d: distance of the linke
				p.s.: Propagation speed (determined by physical medium [coax, fiber optic, copper])
	Total delay = addition of all the delays

Number of hops packet to live - Time to live(til)
User traceroute where the problem is for bottleneck

Windows (tracert)
Mac(traceroute)
Requested timed out are the router that has not be configured to give return time
Each ms is round trip time for each packet
