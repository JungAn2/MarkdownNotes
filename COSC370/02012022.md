Queueing model Networking

Hub -> switch -> router
	Hub = sends message to all connected device
	Switch = Remember which connected device to deliver the message 

DSL/Dial up -> circuit switching


Router determines the best method of switching (most of current router uses packet switching)
Circuit switching
	fixed line/dedicated line
	bandwidth is guaranteed/ not be allocated to others
	slower -> due to dedicated line
	Pro
		Real time synchronization

packet switching
	can choose path.
	breaks down the packet to multiple part
	multiple packet can be traveling at the same time in different order (parallel traveling)
	Packet has to wait until all parts are delivered and sort back in order
	use for situation where certain delay can be tolerated
