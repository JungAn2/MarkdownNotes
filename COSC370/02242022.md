# Socket programming

Socket: Opening channel for communication
- Door to client and server

***Transport layer***

TCP
- Transport control protocol
- UDP
  - User datagram protocol

---
Difference
- TCP
  - Larger packet
  - Control transmition
  - flow control
  - conjestion control
  - more reliable
  - Three way handshake
  - guarentee the connection
  
---

- UDP
  - Send smaller packet
  - Fast and efficient
  - On and off
---
Max number of ports: 2^16^ 

well known reserved ports: 0 ~ 1023

Use 8888 or 9999 when making socket app

AF_INET
- IPV4
  - IPV6 and IPV4 are incompatible

SOCK_DGRAM
- Socket datagram
- Both server and client needs to create socket

modifiedMessage
- (2048) is maximum byte

decode()
- reverts back to be readable

serverSocket.bind(('{hostname}', serverPort))

Look at ppt 2 
- slide 94 UDP client
- slide 95 UDP server

programming hw: Socket programming/ Can work in a team

Need to remember

TCP need to make connection first
- reliable
- byte stream 
- always running(connection is always open)
- If data loss, it will resend
