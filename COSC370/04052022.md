# RTT

get time before and after send.

Subtract one from another and you get RTT
(This is without using any ping or traceroute)

## EstimatedRTT

EstimatedRTT_n = (1-alpha)\*EstimatedRTT_(n-1) + alpha\*sampleRTT

- usually alpha is given
- Initially estimated RTT = sampleRTT

## Timeout interval

Chapter 3 slide 72 (for equation)

# TCP sender

timeout - congestion on the physical media

fast retransmit:
- Sends three duplicate ack
- ACK = sequence number + byte
  
## Flow control
- Receiver side
- shows how many bytes is avaliable
- Then sender will limit the data

ACK 

# TCP congestion control: AIMD

- Do not create traffic on bandwidth

### AIMD
```
A: Additive
I: Increase
    Increase MSS (Maximum segment size)
```
```
M: Multiplicative
D: Decrease
    Cut sending rate in half
```

AIMD is optimized and ensure stability

Congesting level

## TCP slow start
- ramps up exponentially

```
inital cwnd = 1mss
double cwnd every RTT
```

TCP tahoe


Know AIMD and slow start

TCP CUBIC
- better than AIMD and slow start
