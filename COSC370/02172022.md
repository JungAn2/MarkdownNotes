To show all the processes in cmd
- ps
- pid is for client

Server process
- Host ip
- port number
  
Http request
- common
  - Get/ Post
    - Post

Open protocol
- each protocols can communicate each other well


transport layer
Two main protocol
- TCP
- UDP

transport service
- Data integrity
  - reliable data transfer

TCP
- reliable transport
  - Reliable data integriy at the cost of speed
- Flow control
  - sends data faster than receiver, buffer cannot hold
- congestion control
  - The packet data that goes over the bandwidth limit gets lost (throttled)
- does not provide
  - time, throughput guarentee, security

UDP
- unreliable data transport
- does not provid many stuff(just look at slide 12)

## Web and Http

web {hostname}{pathname}

HTTP uses TCP
- client - server

Socket (software level)
- between transportation and application level
- define how processes communicate
- ex. Opening a channel to let the data through
- establish connection between server and client

multiplexing

Two types of HTTP connection
- Non persistent(can speed up with parrell transfer)
    > Tcp connection opened
    > at most one object is sent
    > Tcp connection closed

- Persistent(multiple objects)
    > TCP connection open to server
    > multiple object can be sent
    > TCP connection closed

HTTP request message
- Status line (important)
  - Tells whats going on with http

Stateless = memoryless
- Think of transaction
