IPv6 datagram
- 32 bits
 
Tunneling and Encapsulation
- IPv6 package as payload and being routed inside the IPv4
- IPv6 is encapsulated in IPv4

Tunneling
- The payload is controlled by maximum transmitted unit(MTU)
  - If fragment is true, it will fragment the package into managable size
- If payload is greater than it can handle, it will drop the packet
