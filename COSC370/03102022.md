Lecture notes

Upto UDP protocol checksum

## Socket
UDP / TCP /web server
- Library call UDP

- how do TCP connect

# Priority
- Network performance management(calculations of delays)
  - Processing delays
    - Look up the table and forwarding table
    - Store/forward
      - All the bits have to arrive before transmission starts.
  - Transmission delay
    - Pushing the bits to the link
  - queueing delay
    - Queueing of the data
    - For overflowing the data
  - propagation
    - 
  - throughput
    - Actual amount of time required to transfer bit
    - Often the bottle-neck
  - utilization
    - Amount usage of the bottle-neck
    - Look at the denominator
    - Bottleneck/(client or server)
  - end-end delay
    - Addition of the above
    - Delay from sender(client) to receiver(server)
  

  - Tools
    - Traceroute
    - ping
    - wireshark

- Http protocol
  - Http response Time:
    - 2RTT + transmission time
      - First RTT: Request to connect
      - Second RTT: Response to connect
      - Transmission
  - Request message format
  - Cookie
  - Cache

- DNS, Email
  - DNS
    - Know all the type
    - How it is stored in the database entry
    - type = a
      - Domain name = IP
    - type = mx (mail service)
      - Something else
    - Layer
      - Top level
      - Administrator
      - application
      - look at the knowledge check 2

- Last
  - TCP
    - Flow control
    - congestive control
  - UDP
    - Best efforf delievery
    - Only need to know source port and destination port
  - Can ask what kind of application use TCP and UDP
  - Multiplexing/Deplexing
  - UDP protocol
    - source/destination port
    - checksum
      - Can do basic error (corrupted file)

Transmittion = L/R
- L: Bits / seconds
