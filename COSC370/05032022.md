# link layer

- mac (media access

- transfer to nearby hub
  - Not global

- Framing make the packet smaller
  - Easier to transmit
  - Source and destination MAC address not the IP

- Physical addressing
  - ARP transfer IP to mac and vice versa

- Media access control

- Reliable delivery
  - Wireless is less reliable than cable

- half-duplex
  - one directional at a time
  - can exchange
- Full-duplex
  - bi directional at a time

- can only be contained inside the network

- Linked layer
  - error checking
  - error correction

- error checking
  - parity checking
  - odd number of 1 add 1
  - even number of 1 add 0

- Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
  - Right is least significant, left is most significant
  - G = bit pattern (known to reader and sender) always length(r) + 1
  - D = data
  - r = d*2r / G
