RDT - reliable data transfer
UDT - unreliable data transfer

Principle protocol

RDT 1.0 / 2.0 / 2.1

## rdt 2.0

- data corruption: Receive but with error
    - Handle by rdt 2.0
- data loss: does not receive
  - Handle by rdt 1.0

Labels transition

Receiver:
- Check receive and extract

## rdt2.0


## FSM(finite state machine) specification
- divides sender and receiver

Sender sends and wait either ACK/NAK

## Flaws
- ACK / NAK could be corrupted
  - To address the flaw:
    - It resend with sequence number

# rdt 2.1
- 1 means that it alternates between packets
- Fixes the flaw in 2.0 (ACK/NAK corruption)

# rdt 2.2 (Nak-free protocol)
- Only ACK only

rdt- How to recover data

# rdt 3.0
- Handles both error and data loss
- Same state as 2.0
  - Only difference, includes timeout
  - Resend

Utilization
- L/R

Roundtrip time:
- (L/R)/(RTT+L/R)

Pipeline
- Instead of sending one and waiting for ACK
  - Sends sequence of packet and wait after ACK
  - Buffering the packets

- Go-back-n: sender
  -
