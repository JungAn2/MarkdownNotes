# Chapter 4 Network-layer

network layer adds its own header/ makes it a datagram

uses best efforts model (UDT style)

## Data plane
- local, effects all the routers

switching fabric:


routing processor
- Routers cpu
- checks routing table and outputs to correct ports

Input port functions
- Line termination
  - Physical Media (Copper, fiber optics)
- Link layer
  - Frame
- Lookup forwarding
  - Look at table and forward to corresponding ports
  
Generic: larger classification
Destination: Specific classifcation

ipv4: 32bits 2^32
ipv6: 128bits 2^128

Before fabric works,
Determins which port to put

Usually implemented by hardware

## fabric switch
- Takes actions to transfer output
- Has transmission rate
  - N input : R rates
  - Having same N input and N output, it will be 1 to 1
  - Expensive if 1 to 1
- Have built in buffer (for blocking / bottleneck)

Switching by memory / bus/ interconnection network
- memory
  - Older version
  - save to memory
  - calculate
  - export
- bus (electronic communication system)
  - Older version
  - instead of saving memory, it saves to bus
  - writes out to output port directly
- Interconnection network
  - n^2 grid system
  - Multistage switch

How much buffer is good?
- RTT*C / sqrt(N)
  - C = capacity
