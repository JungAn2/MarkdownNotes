# Notes

IPv6 datagram
- host end to end communication
  - Gets rid of the NAT

RFC 2406 - documentation of IPv6 specification

# Chapter 5
Plane: transfering data (example: actual plane)

- data plane
  - Single router
  - local

- control plane
  - Global
  - network wide router

Network-layer
- Per-router control
  - More distributed
- Logically centralized control
  - SDN(software defined networking)
    - Software controls the network

- SDN
  - All the computer do not communicate with each other
  - goes to centralized location first
  
- Routing protocols
  - Depends on routing algorithm
  - To determine the shorted least cost, least congested, fastest destination path from the source
  
- Dijkstra's link-state routing algorithm
  - cost: network operator determines
    - propagation (material)
    - higher congestion = higher cost
    
- Dijkstra's link-state
  - Get the min that is adjacency to nodes
  - Add that node to the list with cost
  - Get the min that is adjacent to all the ndoes in the list
  - Each has to be path from the origin, so the cost adds up
  - message complexity
    - same as algorithm complexity

- Network topology
