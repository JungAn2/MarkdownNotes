# Switching fabrics

traditional is transfer wby bits by bits

bus
- label matching
  - long prefix matching

input port queuing
- head of the line (HOL) blocking
  - front packet can block the packet behinde even tho it goes to different port

Output port queuing
- buffering
  - link layer have header to add to frame
    - checksum
  - droping policy (buffer overflow)
- Scheduling discipline
  - Highest priority (control)

How much buffering?
- RTT *C
  - C = capacity
- Modern calc
  - RTT*C/sqrt(N)
    - C = capacity
    - N = flow


Buffer management
- drop
  - tail drop - drop arriving packet
  - priority - priority basis
- market
  - send to sender which packet is dropped
    - ECN
      - explicit congestion notification
    - RED
      - Random early detection

Packet scheduling: FCFS
- Priority scehduling
  - first come first serve
  - priority
  - round robin
  - weighted fair queueing
- FCFS

- Priority policy
  - games have more priority compare to email
  - red higher/green lower
- Round Robin
  - every queue take turn
- weigthed fair queueing(WFQ)
  - generalized round robin
  - based on the weight
    - wi/sum(wi)
  - More idealistic situation

Network neutrality
- legal rule in policy
