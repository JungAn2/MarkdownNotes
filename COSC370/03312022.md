Go-back-n
- THe packet is in order
- The Gap detects the error
- Discard any packet after the gap
- 

selective repeat
- holds buffer
- resends each packet after the gap

TCP
- Always open
- In order byte stream
- Both sender/receiver are sender/receiver
- MSS: Maximum segment size

Sequence number
- index for the bytes of data
- Randomly generated by system

When ACK is set
- send ACK(acknowledgement) number
- header length varies

Sync
- Initiate connection
- Send back ACK

RST
- not expecting the packet
- not ready to accept request

Each host initilize their own sequence number
- Initial offset
- Seq and ACK must be same sequence number

Inorder means
- every byte is tracked

TCP round trip time(RTT), timeout
- what is the current time api
- The time difference from send and receive time
- Typically estimated RTT = sampleRTT
- EstimatedRTT = (1-alpha)\*EstimatedRTT(n-1) + alpha\*sampleRTT

DevRTT is usually given
