# Notes

Dijkstra's algorithm
  - path determines the routing path

Distance vector algorithm
  - Dx(y) = minv{cx,v + Dv(y)}
  
Distributed asynchronous
  - Centralized
  - Broadcast to all the neighbor router
  - Sends path information to the neigbor
  
DV used among the autominus

autonomous system = under same administrative control

Usually one ISP = one automous system (AS)

AS get IP from ICANN

router in their or AS must run same routing algorithm

Intra-domain = same AS 

implement dextraous

OSPF (open source)
